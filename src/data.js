Every sunrise feels brighter because of you.  
Every dream feels possible because you inspire me.  
Every challenge feels easier because I imagine you by my side.  

You are not just my friend, you’re the most special part of my life.  
You make me smile, you make my heart race, and you make me want to be a better version of myself.  

I don’t know what the future holds, but I know one thing for sure.
I want that future with you.`
